# RP-PicoController
This project is a versatile project built using the Raspberry Pico W, designed to seamlessly integrate with Home Assistant. This project combines multiple environmental sensors and an infrared controller to provide comprehensive monitoring and control of your indoor climate.

## Features
* Temperature Monitoring: Accurately measures and reports the current temperature.
* Humidity Sensing: Monitors and logs humidity levels in real-time.
* CO2 Concentration Measurement: Tracks the concentration of CO2 in the air, helping to maintain healthy indoor air quality.
* Infrared Air Conditioner Control: Allows remote control of your air conditioning unit via infrared signals.

## Components Used
* Raspberry Pico W
* DHT11/DHT22 Sensor: For temperature and humidity sensing
* MQ-135 CO2 Sensor: For CO2 concentration measurement
* IR LED/IR Module: For sending infrared signals to control the air conditioner
